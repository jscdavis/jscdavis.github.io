<p> Jay Davis' Bio</p>
<p>
	Jay Davis is a Koala working on a Computer Science minor at Tufts University. He hopes to get a good foundational knowledge of Computer Science that will supplement his customized major from the Center interdisciplinary studies, which is focused on applying storytelling techniques from English, Drama and Film to the new interactive stories that are emerging through the video game industry. Games are relatively undeveloped as a literary storytelling medium, so he hopes his work will help expand the feild. Because so much of game production is centered around programming, he hopes that studying Computer Science will give him helpful skills if he works in the video game industry.
