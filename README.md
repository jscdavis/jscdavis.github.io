jscdavis' Lab 4 Site
Almost all implementations are functioning. The only issue I've had is that I couldn't change the color of the paragraph text, and I also didn't make enough css rules because I implemented them with fewer rules and multiple declarations (I couldn't find a better way to do this). This lab took me about 4 hours. I consulted Matt, a friend of mine who goes to the University of Rochester, about html/css syntax. I also used some of the w3 css and html tutorials to help with syntax. I was unsuccessful in manipulating the fonts in a way that I wanted.
