jscdavis' Lab 4 Site
This lab took me about 4 hours. I started by making the index, and then the other html files. Then I created the css files. I used some of the w3 css and html tutorials to help with syntax. I was unsuccessful in manipulating the fonts in a way that I wanted. I'm still confused by the css syntax because certain changes I make just aren't going through to my website. Next week I'll be sure to start the lab earlier in the week so as to have more time to experiment with the new concepts.
